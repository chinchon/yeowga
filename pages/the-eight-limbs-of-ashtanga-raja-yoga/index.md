   Raja yoga is the path of systematic methodology and analysis of releasing the mind.  Compiled by  Patanjali Maharishi, raja yoga  is also  known as ashtanga yoga, because its practices can be divided into eight limbs.

What  we  do  echoes  back.  Suddenly loves arises from the abandonment of violence.  You don’t feel yourself and  loves  takes  over  without  the  need  for  an  object  or  subject.

   When  a  person  is  completely  established  in  non-theft  of  others posessions, al  treasures and ornaments appear and present itself to the person.

Others  belongings  become  more  attractive  to  a  person  than what he has.  When he releases this tension in the mind, the body wil be unable to perform the act and as such the energy created from this non-jealous  attitude,  wil   bring  precious  material  and  non-material things that he can use to evolve into enlightenment.

   When a person is established in sexual continence through the process of  living  like  a  brahma  (God),  it  leads  to  celibacy.  Celibacy  happens,  it cannot be created and practiced.  In the godliness, the energy takes a total y different form.  Celibacy is a consequence of brahmacharya.  It is a  by-product.    It  cannot  be  practiced,  it  has  to  happen.    Because practicing celibacy is suppression.  There are masks.  It has to be created for  someone  to  believe  you.  The  more  violent  a  person  is,  the  more sexual  the  person  wil   be.  Sex  can  exists  in  anger,  violence,  theft, jealousy  and  so  on.  Once  a  person  is  completely  established  in brahmacharya, courage and strength takes over, and you wil  find ways to penetrate others without sex.

   Having  and  having  more  has  no  meaning.  When  a  person  is  firmly established  and  centred  in  non-possessiveness  or  Aparigraha,  he  wil have complete knowing of past and future incarnations, past and future happenings  of  himself  and  others.    The  energy  arises  to  reveal  to  the person hidden knowings.  Non-grasping attitude leads to knowledge of the how and wherefore of existence.  When you are aware that nothing can be possessed, suddenly your whole energy moves inwards towards you. Being established in non-possessiveness, al  the possibilities of how, why, where and when about the various existences are revealed to you.

The  previous  5  yamas  gives  purity  to  the  being.    These  are  not morals.  Through  purity,  the  grossness  of  the  person  disappears,  you become centred within your temple and the honey of the person shines.

   Disgust of the body does not arise from Saucha. The yogi does not hate his body nor does he become a narcissist. He is not a perverted person.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Fasting can be a torture of the body which is violence or fasting can be a form  of  purification  of  the  senses  and  body.  Through  saucha  the  yogi becomes  disil usioned  about  the  body.    When  you  are  too  much concerned  about  the  body,  you  tend  to  yearn  or  urge  for  the  contact with  another  body.    The  person  uses  others  body  for  self-gratification which  they  cal   love.    This  is  not  love,  but  lust,  perversion.  So  a  man keeps on looking for a woman’s body and vice versa for self-gratification.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Love is beyond the body. In a crowd, your body feels very good but the soul feels starved, claustrophobic.  In aloneness, the body feels hungry for  relationship  but  the  soul  feels  very  good.  The  soul  enlivens  when alone. The idea of the other is also not there. From the body to the soul, matter  to  non-matter,  visible  to  invisible,  from  the  known  to  the unknown.  From  mental  purity  arises  power  of  concentration, cheerfulness,  control  of  the  senses  and  readiness  for  self-realisation.

   There is no need to have contact with others.

   Being  contented,  supreme  joy  is  achieved.  We  seek  pleasure  from external  objects,  subjects  and  fantasies  created  from  our  internal thoughts. We continue to seek happiness from these external sources.

  <p class="calibre1">
   We normal y seek things that we do not have and start dreaming about it.    Without  appreciation  of  what  we  have,  we  are  diverted  to  the extremes of pleasure and pain. By nature’s creation we are unable to be contented  due  to  the  control  of  the  mind,  which  is  unable  to  be achieved.  Mind cannot be contented.  It wil  lose its function. Chaos wil happen  when  you  are  not  contented,  outside  of  you  or  inside  of  you, inspite  of  you.  Whenever  you  are  cheerful  you  forget  the  body.

   Whenever you are in sorrow, you cannot forget the body. So when you don’t feel the body, you become free, contented and cheerful.  So only a yogi forgets a body and become healthy. When you become ill, example with  a  headache,  suddenly  the  head  becomes  your  focus.    You  start feeling the pain and discomfort. You become conscious of the head and become miserable.  You seek others company to relieve the headache.

   If  you  move  deep  with  this  body,  you  wil   discover  deeper phenomenons.    There  are  in  total  7  bodies.  The  subtle  body  in meditation can move into a higher frequency and at times lift the gross body.  You  wil   only  encounter  the  subtle  body  when  the  gross  body becomes pure. The body goes on accumulating many dead tissues and cel s.  Fasting,  natural  eating,  deep  rhythmic  breathing,  yoga,  living  a more  natural  supple  life,  creating  less  subtle  attitudes  are  al   cal ed austerities.  It does not mean to torture the body, but to clean the body through consistent, unbroken efforts. New energy, new dimension, new possibilities  wil   arise  from  performing  austerities.    Every  sense  has  a hidden  power  behind  it.    Now  you  are  unable  to  see  the  aura  of someone.  Once the eyes are cleaned, you start seeing the aura and a person  wil   not  be  able  to  trick  you.    A  dishonest  man’s  aura  has  a different colour, the more white moves to grey and final y black.

   By  mastery  of  the  active  and  cognitive  senses  of  the  physical  body,  a person can eliminate or remove the impurities of the body.  This is done through the intense, uninterrupted efforts known as tapasah. We need to awaken our internal strengths to work the senses. The way to know the mystery of man, is to know the mystery of yourself.

   Asana  should  be  steady,  stable,  and  motionless.  Asana  means  “to  take  seat here”  in  Sanskrit.  Al   poses  and  acts  are  a  kind  of  asana.  It  should  be motionless, steady with regulated breathing pattern, which leads to comfort of the mind without swings or pain, pleasure or suffering.

  <p class="calibre1">
   For  spiritual  sadhana,  as  for  any  other  pursuit  in  life,  a  healthy  and  strong system  is    essential.    Steady,  non-swaying  mind  or  no-mind,  presupposes steady  body.    Attain  one-pointedness  of mind  through  the  practice  of  asana and forget about the body. In practice we prepare the body for steadying of the consciousness. The 840,000 poses help to regulate our body systems and the 72,000 nadis so that they are calmed and operate efficiently.  At any point when an asana is not steady or uncomfortable, the mind uses this opportunity to  start  its  game.  Steady  means  the  head,  neck  and  trunk  are  in  proper alignment  without  discomfort  and  the  spine  adopts  the  natural  curves.

   science  of  pranayama  is  the  technique  of  expansion  of  prana  without movement of thoughts or thinking.  The subtle energy that moves along with air,vayu, is what we call prana.

The  modern  mind  wants  everything  instantly  but  their  bodies and  minds  are  not  ready  to  accept  the  sudden  changes  that  happen immediately.  Whether  you  are  inhaling  or  exhaling,  whatever  duration  or space, if it is creating a thought, you should let the thought disappear. Don’t cling on  to  the thought and form a chain reaction of thoughts. The negative aspect of this is, when body is not ready, you may get frustrated. Don't stop the breathing, which you can’t, so the next best thing is to make it prolonged.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The  senses  are  matter  or  things  used  by  your  inner  space.  The  mind  works through  the  senses  to  experience  the  external  happenings  by  going  through the pleasures or pain of the events. If the mind is capable of withdrawing its control over the senses and moves inwards to the source or origin, this is what we cal  pratyahara. By withdrawing the mind away from the senses, the senses return to their inner space.  As this happens, a concurrent inner peace and joy happens without any real effort.   The  moment  your senses sense something exciting, they come alive and distract your mind and the inner bliss is lost.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   As the mind functions in a way to such that it prevents you from experiencing the inner bliss, it constantly wants the senses to get excited by creating subtle as wel  as gross ideas.  Ideas are formed through an accumulation of thoughts put together.  The ideas slowly develop into habits which become attachments and as attachments become mightier we develop an attitude of non-surrender.

  <p class="calibre1">

  <p class="calibre1">
   The process of the mind going through the senses is the constant distraction. A conscious decision has to be made, to withdraw the mind and restore it to the original  stuff  out  of  which  it's  made,  without  going  through  the  different happenings  of  the  5  senses  and  being  in  the  space  of  joy  which  happens without happening.

   Dhyaan simplistical y is translated as the uninterrupted flow of the mind etc, then  you  can  meditate  on  anything  but  this  would  not  lead  you  to enlightenment. Then what is the use of the meditation? Even if anyone retain this boundary enlightenment cannot happen. You can meditate on any object or subject and if the boundary is lost, you instantly become enlightened. When the boundaries are lost you wil  experience the state of Samadhi. This subtle difference  is  the  most  important  difference  that  differentiates  between  an enlightened master and an unenlightened master.  The magic is always in the differences.  Losing the boundaries wil  raise you to the state of Dhyana. Right understanding of techniques wil  also raise your level of practice.
