   The Story of The Foolish Lion and the clever rabbit
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Once upon a time, there lived a ferocious and greedy lion which kil ed animals indiscriminately. Seeing this, the animals of the forest came up with a plan to sacrifice  one  animal  of  each  species  a  day  to  the  lion.  When  it  came  to  the rabbits' turn, they chose a very wise and old rabbit. It took its own sweet time to meet the Lion. The Lion was getting impatient and swore to kil  al  animals the next day.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The rabbit came to the Lion before sunset. The Lion was angry but the wise old rabbit remained calm and slowly told the Lion that it was not his fault. He told the Lion that a group of rabbits were supposed to come to him for the day. But on the way, another angry Lion attacked them and ate all the rabbits except himself. He said the other Lion was chal enging the supremacy of his Lordship.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The Lion was natural y very enraged and asked to be taken to the location of the other Lion.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The wise rabbit agreed and led the Lion towards a deep wel  fil ed with water.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Then he showed the Lion his reflection in the water of the wel . The Lion was furious and started growling and natural y the  “other Lion” also displayed its anger. Then the Lion jumped into the wel  and so lost its life. This was how the wise rabbit saved the forest and its inhabitants from the proud Lion.
