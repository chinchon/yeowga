   The shape of this pose resembles a dog stretching its spine and legs.

  <p class="calibre1">
   It  was  only  in  recent  times  that  the  Brahmins  of  India  classified  the  dog  as unclean. But in actual fact, the dog had a prominent place throughout Indian history in various forms.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">

  <p class="calibre1">
   In  parts  of  India  especial y  eastern  states  like  Orissa,  the  supreme  spirit  is represented by Bhairava, a form of Shiva, who either takes on the form of a dog  or  more  commonly  has  dog  companions  or  vehicles  (vahanas).  These deities  appear  in  Nepalese  Buddhism  as  Yamantaka,  a  wrathful  spirit  who conquers the forces of death.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">

  <p class="calibre1">
   Interestingly in Vedic literature, many deities have dog companions. Indra has his companion and messenger, the faithful dog cal ed Sarama. She gives birth to  two  sons,  the  Sarameyas,  who  in  turn  become  the  companions  and messengers of Yama, the lord of death.

   One  of  the  most  memorable  dog  stories  from  Indian  literature  involves  the heroic  Pandava  brothers  of  the  Mahabharata.  When  King  Dharmaraja,  his brothers and al  their families set off on their final journey up the Himalayas, 57

   each  one  fell  until  the  only  ones  left  were  King  Dharmaraja  and  his  dog companion.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   As they neared the top of the mountain, they were greeted by god Indra in his chariot.  The  God  lauded  Dharmaraja  and  said  that  he  had  earned  a  place  in heaven.  He  asked  the  king  to  board  the  chariot  and  as  he  did,  Dharmaraja cal ed for his dog. However, Indra protested saying that dogs were not al owed in his heaven.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Upon hearing this, Dharmaraja said that he could not abandon such a faithful companion who depended on him. He declared he would rather stay on earth than abandon his dog. Final y, Indra relented and both were taken to heaven.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Upon  arriving,  the  dog  transformed  into  the  god  Dharma,  the  lord  of  the correct way of living.
