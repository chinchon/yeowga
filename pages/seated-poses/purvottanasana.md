   Story:
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   There is a beautiful story in Ramayana about Hanuman and his mother, Sita.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   After the great war was over, Sita gave Hanuman a necklace of priceless pearls as a reward for his heroism and devotion.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   In front of the assembled crowd of nobles and learned, Hanuman pul ed the necklace  apart,  holding  each  beautiful  pearl  up  to  his  ear,  shaking  it,  then throwing it to the ground in disgust.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Sita  asked  in  shock:  "What  are  you  doing?"  Hanuman  replied  his  mother:  "I wanted  to  see  if  the  pearls  were  saying  the  name  of  Rama.  Only  something which  says  the  name  of  the  Lord  has  meaning  to  me."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   "A  pearl  is  an  inanimate  object.  It  cannot  speak,"  said  Sita.  But  Hanuman countered:  "Everything  that  is  saturated  with  the  love  of  Rama  speaks  his name." Hanuman then pulled a handful of hair from his chest and held it  to Sita's ears. Every hair on Hanuman's body was softly chanting "RAM."
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Then to everybodyâ€™s awe and surprise, Hanuman ripped his chest open. In his heart  was  an  image  of  Rama  and  Sita.  This  shows  the  devotion  one  has  for Rama and for someone who loves another. This pose helps to open the heart chakra  and  reveal  the  goodness  in  every  human  being.  It  enhances  the  love and devotion we have for ourselves and others.
