   In  the  story  of  Adam  and  Eve,  the  serpent  possessed  the  knowledge  of discrimination  between  good  and  evil.  This  pose  promotes  our  capacity  for discrimination as we evolve to a higher level of consciousness.

   “The Serpent in the Jiva or Individual soul rests upon Siva, the Paramatman or the Supreme Spirit. The five hoods mean the five senses or the five Tattvas, viz, earth, water, fire, air and ether. They also represent the five Pranas, which hiss in the body like the serpent. The inhalation and exhalation are like the hissing of the serpent. Lord Shiva Himself became the five Tanmantras, the five Jnana Indriyas, the five Karmendriyas and other groups of five. The individual spirit enjoys the worldly object through these Tattvas. When the individual attains knowledge through control of the senses and mind, he finds his eternal resting abode in Lord Shiva, the Supreme Spirit. This is the esoteric significance of Lord Shiva wearing the snake on His body.”

   The  story  is  that  the  great  serpent  Ananta  (or  Adishesha),  the  bed  of  Lord Vishnu the Preserver, wished to descend to Earth to teach Yoga to humans. At the  same  time  there  was  a  woman  named  Gonika  who  was  praying  to  Lord Shiva for a son to be born while standing in the river. Gonika was virtuous and a woman of good character. As she prayed, Lord Shiva was happy, and Ananta fel   into  the  river  sand  into  her  hands.  Minute  in  size,  in  half-human,  half-serpent form, Ananta announced himself as her son.  She named him Patanjali, which means “that which fal s into praying hands” (pata=fal en, anjali=praying hands).
