    THE 3 GUNAS AND BEYOND

  <p class="calibre1">

  <p class="calibre1">
   The  Three  Gunas  have  been  defined  as  ‘the  three  fundamental  qualities  or attitudes’  of  the  manifest  energy.  Energy  in  unmanifested  form  is  known  as Brahman  but  when  it  is  expressed  in  a  form,  it  divides  into  3  fundamental natural  qualities  or  attitudes  or  frequency  known  as
   <b class="calibre3">
    Sattvic,  Rajasic  and
   </b>
   <b class="calibre3">
    Tamasic
   </b>
   .  This  in  reality  or  in  the  manifested  reality  exists  in  al   that  can  be seen, moving or unmoving. As Brahman manifest itself, it takes on a form, with an attitude or quality to perform tasks as defined by its overwhelming quality embedded  in  the  system  (form  and  nature  inclusive).  Some  manifestations have  a  combination  of  the  3  gunas  in  varying  degrees,  thus  explaining  the myriad living and non-living things. When all the 5 compounds (earth, water, fire, air, space) are found in the body of matter, it becomes a living thing with consciousness.  When  at  least  one  of  the  compound  is  non-existent  in  the matter, it becomes a non-living thing.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   So these 3 basic qualities become the fundamental reasons to classify things from the gross like food and people to the most subtle, mind and attitudes. A combination of the 3 from the multitude integrated to make a whole and al  of us have bites of it. To expand it further, they cannot be label ed as good, bad and  all  the  dualities  we  associate  with  actions  and  results  of  the  actions.  By nature  they  act  because  they  supposed  to  act  this  way.  For  example,  a  lion does  not  eat  plants  because  by  nature  of  its  creation  it  is  not  made  to  eat plants, similarly an elephant does not eat the flesh of another. Is the lion bad and is the elephant good? No, they neither. They are not to do certain things.

  <p class="calibre1">
   What  is  more  crucial  to  understand  is  to  recognise  the  3  gunas  within ourselves,  become  aware  of  their  doings  and  effects  in  our  lives,  how  it motivates  our  actions  or  how  it  de  motivates  our  actions,  gain  experiences from them. Once the experience is understood, using the experience but not the  effects  of  the  experience  for  the  next  course  of  action.  That  is,  we  got angry, understand the anger, experience it in its totality, reactions may come from  the  anger  but  we  should  not  use  the  reactions  from  the  anger  for  the Copyrights reserved.

   THE 3 GUNAS AND FOOD
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   In yoga philosophy, the mind is formed from the subtlest portion or essence of food.  If the food taken is pure, the mind has the proper building materials for the development of a strong and subtle intel ect and a good memory.  A yogic diet  is  one  that  brings  inner  peace  to  the  body  and  mind  and  encourages spiritual progress.

    SATTVIC FOODS
   </b>
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The  foods  which  increase  life,  purity,  strength,  health,  joy  and  cheerfulness, which are savoury and oleaginous, substantial and agreeable, are dear to the sattvic people.  – Bhagavad Gita, XVII, 8
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Pure  foods  that  increase  vitality,  energy,  vigour,  health  and  joy,  that  are delicious,  wholesome,  substantial  and  agreeable  are  sattvic.    These  foods render the mind pure and calm and generate equanimity, poise and peaceful tendencies.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Foods should be as fresh and natural as possible, preferably organical y gown, not  genetical y  modified,  and  kept  without  preservatives  or  artificial flavourings.  They should also be eaten in as natural a state as possible either raw, steamed or lightly cooked.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Grains  such  as  corn,  barley,  wheat,  unpolished  rice,  oats,  mil et  and  quinoa.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Make  sure  you  include  in  your  diet  coarse  foods  such  as  porridge  and wholegrain breads.  These are good for the teeth and jaws, and they stimulate the  processes  of  digestion  and  elimination.    Grains  supply  the  necessary carbohydrates, the main source of energy for the body, and they also contain about half the amino acids that are needed to form protein.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Protein foods such as pulses, nuts and seeds.  Proteins are the ‘building blocks’
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   of the body.  The key to a healthy vegetarian diet is to eat a good mixture of foods  to  ensure  that  it  includes  al   the  amino  acids  essential  for  making proteins.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Dairy products such as milk, butter, cheese and yoghurt.   Traditionally  these are an essential part of the yoga diet.  However, modern dairy practice abuses animals, fil ing their milk with hormones and antibiotics.  Even if you choose to use dairy products, we recommend that you do so in moderation.  They tend to intensify the production of mucus, which interferes with the natural flow of breath.

    RAJASIC FOODS

  <p class="calibre1">
   Foods that are bitter, sour, saline, excessively hot, pungent, dry and burning, are liked by the rajasic and are productive of pain, grief and disease.  Bhagavad Gita, XVII, 9
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The yoga diet avoids rajasic foods because they over stimulate the body and mind.  They excite the passions and boisterous tendencies, cause physical and mental  stress,  bring  a  restless  state  of  mind  and  destroy  the  mind-body balance  that  is  essential  to  happiness.    Onions,  garlic,  radishes,  coffee,  tea, tobacco, and stimulants of al  kinds fal  into this category, as do heavily spiced and  salted,  chemical-riddled,  convenience  foods  and  snacks.    Sattvic  food taken  in  the  wrong  place  e.g.  eaten  on  the  run  becomes  rajasic.    Refined (white) sugar, soft drinks, prepared mustards, pungent spices, highly seasoned foods and anything that is excessively hot, bitter, sour, saline are al  rajasic are best avoided.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Strong spices and condiments over-stimulate the  mind as wel  as  irritate  the mucous membrane of the intestines.  Rajasic foods increase, lust, anger, greed, selfishness, violence and egoism, which are barriers that separate people from each other and their realization of the Divine.  Rajas is the energy that creates dissension in life and wars in the world.

   That food which is stale, tasteless, putrid, rotten and impure refuse, is the food liked by the tamasic.  -  Bhagavad Gita, XVII, 10
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Tamasic  food  makes  a  person  dul ,  inert  and  lazy;  it  robs  individuals  of  high ideals,  purpose  and  motivation.    In  addition  it  accentuates  the  tendency  to suffer from chronic ailments and depression, and fil s the mind with darkness, anger and impure thoughts.  Abandoning tamasic food needs to be among the first positive lifestyle changes you make.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Meat,  fish,  al   intoxicants  (alcoholic  beverages,  marijuana,  opium,  etc.)  are tamasic in nature.  Meat-eating and alcoholism are closely al ied.  The craving for alcohol dies a natural death when meat is withdrawn from the diet.

  <p class="calibre1">
   There is one more guna (nature or attitude) which we have not talked about so far. That is, moving to the brahman while stil  being embodied is the state of enlightenment that most yogis talk about.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The  moment  we  drop  the  gunas  as  the  stimulus  to  perform  our  actions,  we have moved to the 4th state or guna, which is cal ed Samadhi, where we merge with nature in its original form, Brahman.

  <p class="calibre1">
   When  we  see  our  mind  as  separate,  our  body  as  separate  while  being integrated,  we  see  something  that  is  beyond  embodiment.  This  is  a  state rather than a location or goal.

   When one transcends the mind, through the mind, using the mind as the tool to  our  transcendence,  we  realise  we  are  not  the  mind,  and  we  merge  with Brahman  and  see  everything  as  equal  in  its  original  essence.  There  is  not differentiation other than physical y.  The techniques that we use to transcend the  mind  is  can  be  through  dhrana,  dhyana,  pranayama  or  even  asana.
