   Enlightenment is not a goal it is a consequence of a wider life of a person who is  always  present.  When  a  sincere  seeker  sits  with  the  master,  both  get fulfilled. The master is contented and seeker is also contented.  When you melt with the Master, the transmission of the light and lamp happens radiantly.  The initiation will, you will be able to practice the system systematically. Thousands of things happen at the same to the mil ions of cel s in the body and brain.  The initiation happens without any initiation. The seeker who sincerely takes to the spiritual path without the Master and begins to do systematic sadhana finds oneself  face  to  face  with  certain  peculiar  difficulties  and  disappointing experiences.    This  may  dismay  and  discourage  the  beginner.    But  these problems  and  obstacles  are  common  to  many  aspirants.    Therefore  it  is important  to  know  and  understand  about  them,  and  to  implement  suitable methods of overcoming them.

   PRE-CONCEIVED IDEAS

   Many  sadhakas  (spiritual  aspirants)  start  their  spiritual  lives  with  wel -

   developed preconceptions about sadhana, realization, guru, and the like.  But true  spiritual  life  is  often  quite  different  from  what  the  individual  fondly remembers, experiences and imagines it to be.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   •  Many things are found to be at variance with a person’s mental picture.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Realities  at  times  turn  out  to  be  absolutely  contradictory  to  fondly cherished pre-formed ideas.  More often than not, neophytes are unable to  reconcile  these  rude  shocks  and  unexpected  eye-openers.    They quickly retrace their steps and return to  their former deluded, sensual and

   life.

  <p class="calibre1">
   This is the greatest of blunders.  A peerless gem has been grasped and then foolishly thrown away.  A priceless opportunity is lost.  The mind wil   once  again  pursue  with  vigour  the  same  sensual  grooves.    What takes  place  is  that  the  aspirant  does  not  wish  to  let  go  of  the  long cherished conceptions.  The ego clings to them.  For instance, there may be a certain idea of what constitutes sadhana.  Or one imagines that the person whom one accepts as guru should prescribe certain sadhana.  If this does not happen, dissatisfaction makes its appearance.

   •  The would-be aspirant thinks that a guru should behave in a pre-defined manner.  If the latter does not, loyalty is affected.  To surrender to the feet of the guru, and then begin to doubt or dislike the conduct, is the most awful and colossal error  that an aspirant can commit.   A  knife is laid at the very root of sadhana and spiritual life.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   •  Often  the  sadhaka  enters  the  path  with  a  particular  estimation  of  his own spiritual progress and stage that has been reached.  Nature alone real y knows where exactly we stand.  Yet, the sadhaka wil  act according to  previous  notions.    When  later  events  prove  him  wrong, disappointment  appears  and  enthusiasm  vanishes.    Al   this  is  total y disil usioning the person.  To be preyed upon by a series of disil usions and disappointments at the very start of spiritual life, is a handicap, but necessary.    It  cripples  the  capacity  and  urge  for  sadhana.    Many  lose heart,  and  become  disgusted  with  spiritual  life  but  intensity  and continuous sadhana and vairagya, one is able to progress.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   •  Sadhana should be undertaken with keen enthusiasm and joy.  It is best to  begin  the  life  of  sadhana  with  an  open  mind.    Be  free  of  cramping preconceived  notions  formed  out  of  your  own  egoism.    Approach spiritual life with a sincere receptive attitude, with the idea to learn.  Be prepared to adapt yourself to them, instead of foolishly wishing them to adjust  themselves  to  suit  your  mental  pattern.    Without  this  attitude, disharmony wil  mark the very beginning of your sadhana.  You wil  fal into a state of dejection very hard to come out from.  This wil  colour the entire  course  of  subsequent  sadhana;  valuable  years  wil   be  wasted.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Tyaga (renunciation) of pet notions and peculiar ways of thinking is quite necessary, if you wish to enter and proceed on the path smoothly.  Then, as you proceed, you yourself wil  understand things gradual y.  They wil become clear to you one by one.

   MISCELLANEOUS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS OF DUTY/DHARMA
   <b class="calibre3">

  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   The second thing that invariably vexes beginners is miscel aneous thoughts and ideas of duty.  Curiously enough, as long as you are not doing any sadhana, or thinking of pursuing the spiritual path, no such idea of duty bothers you.  More Copyrights reserved.

   likely, you are indifferent or even negligent towards your duties to kith and kin.

   Your parents may be urging you to find a job and contribute to the upkeep of the family.  But you turn a deaf ear and enjoy cinemas and restaurants.  If you get  a  job,  you  may  begin  wearing  fashionable  clothes.    But,  you  won’t  mind your mother and sister washing and wearing the same pair of old clothes on alternate days.  But when the questions of sadhana and spiritual life come, the mind wil  say, ‘you have duties towards your family’.  Only then do you begin to worry about failing in your duty to mother, brother, sister and others.  These ideas  occur  only  now,  when  you  take  to  the  path  of  sadhana.    You begin  to waver,  hesitate  and  weaken.    Added  to  this,  there  wil   be  the  dissuasion  of friends and their opposition to al  things spiritual.  They wil  say, “What is al this japa, Dhyana and the wearing of mala.  Such things have got their proper time.  You may attend to them when the time comes.  Do your immediate duty first”.  This wil  snuff out the little aspiration with which you started.

  <p class="calibre1">
   This is a typical deception of the mind.  Mind is Maya.  Its function is to prevent us from getting a glimpse of the Reality.  It ever seeks to veil Truth.  Therefore you have to be alert, and continuously counter its moves at every step.  Just when you seek to enter the spiritual path, the mind wil  create many ideas of duty, responsibility, important undertaking, which never troubled you before.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Be ful y aware of this.

  <p class="calibre1">
   You  have  different  duties  at  different  times.    But  to  do  sadhana  for  Self-realisation is the most important and urgent duty that is present throughout your life right up to the last moment.  You cannot afford to postpone or delay it,  even  for  one  single  moment.    Fix  this  idea  firmly  in  your  mind.    Do  not waver.  Start regular and systematic sadhana from the very second you read this  line.    Now  put  a  bookmark  in  this  page,  close  the  book,  and  sit  silent, relaxed, and straight with closed eyes.  Think about the lofty purpose of life, how it is meant solely for spiritual sadhana.  Repeat the Lord’s name for ten minutes.    You  have  made  a  good  beginning  now.    Enter  the  spiritual  path, proceed undauntedly.  Push on with determination and vigour.  Fix your mind once and for al  firmly upon the ideal to be attained.  You wil  reach the Goal in this very life.

    WHAT IS YOGA?

   Sage Patanjali, a rare enlightened master, brings a total y, techniqual y sound, prescisely  cutting  edge  technology  to  people  of  the  modern  times.    In  his second sutra he declares that
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Yoga is the cessation (nirodhah, regulation, channeling, mastery, coordination, quieting) of the modifications (gross and subtle thought patterns) of the mind field. Unfortunately, the word nirodhah has no words to describe in the English language. A simple misunderstanding of the sutra is enough to make your life a living hell. Mind is not linear.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   As long as you think mind is a linear mechanism, al  your efforts to stop it wil fail. Your practice wil  be tainted with failure after failure. So, Nirodhah means disappearance  of  the  mind  on  its  own  spontaneously,  it  does  not  mean stopping.  Patanjali did not visualize mind as a linear movement, if it was linear, he  would  have  used  the  word  Virodhah  (to  obstruct,  to  stop).  Wrong understandings, lead to waste of energy, effort and creates enmity.

   Only if you move of out the body, you will understand everything of the body and only if you move out of the mind, you wil  understand everything about the  mind.  Body  is  a  machine,  which  retains  al   the  biological  memories.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre1">
   Experiments done on the body which is not alive does not apply to the living body. In Yoga, the body is a sheath of consciousness.

   With  the  decision  to  start  regular  sadhana,  you  may  find  yourself  beset  by obstacles and difficulties on every side.   This may lead you to believe  that  it was  the  commencement  of  sadhana  that  started  al   the  trouble.    You  may panic and think that you were better off before.  Do not be dismayed.  There is a reason for this.  Sadhana implies imposing certain restrictions upon yourself.

  <p class="calibre1">
   Previously, as you fol owed the course of the senses, you never came against any opposition from them.  Now, as you enter a path that is primarily one of discipline,  both  external  and  internal,  the  mind  comes  into  conflict  with  the unruly,  self-wil ed  senses.

   everything seems to be wonderful y pleasant.  But it is hard work to pedal up-hil   against  age-long  samsaric  tendencies.    However  this  is  the  means  of regaining the height that you lost in your unchecked downward descent into the abyss of gross worldliness.

  <p class="calibre1">

  <p class="calibre1">
   In the beginning, the neophyte is quite unused to this struggle and strain.  The concerted onrush of difficulties may confuse and unnerve you for a time.  This is  but  natural.    Do  not  be  perturbed;  bear  up  with  fortitude.    The  initial difficulties wil  soon vanish, and you wil  gain strength day by day.  If you think about the troubles and risks you endure in worldly matters of a little monetary gain, some business deal, an examination or a law suit, then you wil   readily put up the difficulties you are faced with upon entering the spiritual path.  Bear in mind the infinite, immeasurable, and imperishable Atmic treasure that you wil  attain ultimately.

   On the spiritual path, a little pain wil  bestow limitless gain.  Success is sure to one  who  does  a  little  sacrifice.    Up  til   now,  the  sadhaka  was  moving  in  a narrow circle, sacrificing a portion of the finite to get another portion of the same  perishable  finite.    Now,  entering  upon  the  glorious  spiritual  path,  the sadhaka,  sacrificing  the  transitory  finite  things,  endeavours  to  obtain  THAT

   which is eternal and infinite.

   Enter now upon the sadhana marga (spiritual path) with an open mind, free of all  prejudices.    Be  ful y  aware  of  the  indispensable  duty  of  doing  spiritual sadhana.  Bear up calmly and cheerful y with al  initial trials and tests.  You wil inherit eternal life, everlasting splendour, peace and bliss. The body and mind are  like  plasticine.    Daily  we  can  make  it  the  way  we  want  it.  Consciously creating  the  way  you  want  it  is  a  yogic  way.  Extraordinary  experiences  and powers can be claimed just by daily untiring practice of dharana, dhyana and Samadhi.
